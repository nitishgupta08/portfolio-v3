            I am a software engineer with two years of experience specializing
            in backend development, primarily using C/C++ and Django. I focus on
            building scalable, high-performance systems with robust technical
            foundations. While my professional expertise lies in backend
            technologies, I have also explored frontend development through
            personal side projects.

            When I’m not with my laptop, I enjoy exploring new places, enjoying
            great stories in theatres or in video games, experimenting in the
            kitchen, and staying active with sports & gym.
